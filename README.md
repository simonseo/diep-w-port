## About

This calculator implements the DIEP-W formula for estimating DIEP (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator) flap weight in breast reconstruction surgery. The formula is based on clinical research conducted at Samsung Medical Center.

### Clinical Use

The DIEP-W calculator helps plastic surgeons estimate the weight of tissue available for autologous breast reconstruction, aiding in:
- Pre-operative planning
- Patient consultation
- Bilateral reconstruction symmetry planning

## Clinical Validation

Based on clinical research from Samsung Medical Center, Department of Plastic Surgery.
